                    <p>Anyone can be a manager and get to end goals with basic skills, but it takes a complex balance of intelligence, mentorship and follow through to be a true leader and to accomplish what Nic has done at ON24.  He is always thinking 18-24 months ahead - how to invest in himself so that he can be better for his people and how he can grow to drive superior results for his organization.</p>
                    <p></p>

He has simultaneously given me a foundational and strategic understanding of SaaS technologies.  He has opened me up to new ways of thought and completely restructured how I view critical components of corporate operations.  He has been a true mentor - a leader like no other.  I simply can not wait to see what he accomplishes next.</p>

                    <p>I would divide my respect for Nic's accomplishments into three key areas:</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>1. MD of EMEA - as our Managing Director for EMEA, Nic transformed our execution (particularly on the Sales side), by re-focusing the teams on quantitatively-driven sales management techniques, which resulted in massive growth in our subscription revenue.</p>
                    <p>2. Sales leader peer - Nicolas is a voracious consumer of business texts, as well as a selfless sharer of insights and distilled learnings from that research.  I open every email from him with curiosity and interest, and virtually always find pearls that I can implement in my own day-to-day operations.</p>
                    <p>3. Expert in Sales Enablement / Automation field - Nicolas has become extremely interested in sales automation over the past 18-24 months, and has made himself an expert in the area through a multitude of demonstrations, consultations, and texts. I will definitely look to him for advice on how best to outfit my sales teams for success as I proceed in my career.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>In my experience, Nic is a great analyst on almost any business challenge, with extraordinary passion and knowledge specifically in the areas of SaaS and Sales Automation.  </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>I plan to continue my association with him throughout my career, as he has proven to be an invaluable resource and a proven producer.</p>

                    <p>Regardless of how many knock-backs he encounters Nic will persist and try another route. However, what sets Nic apart from others is his ability to not be blinded by that focus. Instead, he is very aware of what goes on around him and is able to create win-win situations for himself and others he works with (and for).<span id="points">..</span></p>
                    <span id="moreText">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>As a result, working with Nic is an experience that also pushes others to excel and continually improve. The outcome is not blind ambition, but positive achievement. </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Nic is a natural leader, well beyond being merely a manager, and he involves his team in a way that motivates and brings out the best in them.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>Nic is extremely smart and business-savvy. To say he is well-informed in the B2B tech and SaaS area is an understatement. He is able to spot early and small differentiators that set successful companies and individuals apart and apply them to his own area of business.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>I have worked alongside Nic as a colleague, as well as under him as a leader, for over 5 years. From a personal and professional perspective, during that time, I have got to know him as a person with a strong moral compass, who is fair, open and honest, and extremely positive. </p>

                    <p>Nic has never been afraid to admit when he is not the subject matter expert but you can rest assured he will do everything he can to become more knowledgeable. This he shares and advocates constantly, inspiring everyone around him to do the same.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>As a sales leader he is arguably the best – a leader and a warrior who always puts his people before himself and the best person to have in your corner when required.</p>

                    <p>Almost single handedly Nic built a solid robust channel presence here in Europe and then went on to lead the entire Sales Team ultimately the entire EMEA organization. What Nic has achieved here in Europe is now seen as the benchmark globally here at ON24, testament to his commitment, his vision and his huge success</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>In my 3 years working here at ON24 he has proven to be an exceptional coach, outstanding leader and the best mentor I could have hoped for, It has been a pleasure working with him.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>I have no doubt that what he chooses to set his mind to he will accomplish, he truly is a visionary in the B2B Tech and SaaS environment, he will achieve great things - that I am sure of! </p>

            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

            <p class="section_subtitle blue">NOT YOUR TYPICAL SALES LEADER</p>

            <div class="nic_blurb">

                <p>Hi,</p>

                <p>My name is Nicolas Deville. You can call me Nic.</p>

                <p>I'm French-Austrian, grew up in Paris, living now in Germany after 10 years in London.</p>

                <p>Been in Sales for most of my life, starting when I was a kid, working with my mother for pocket money, helping her as a freelance B2B rep in the 90's!</p>

                <p>Climbed the Sales career ladder to be the youngest VP Sales, then Managing Director Europe (2x).<br>Both times in VC-backed SaaS startups, encompassing leadership of all local functions (Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, Operations) with a team of 30+.</p>

                <p>Both companies IPO'ed.</p>

                <p>Left the "employee" world in 2017.</p>
                    
                <p>Bootstrapped & sold two platforms: 
                
                <ul>
                <li>Convolus.com - a Groupon for private jet operators.<br>Sold in 2019 to our US competitor.</li>
                <li><a href="https://officebots.io/" target="_blank">OfficeBots.io</a> - a Robotic Process Automation platform for office tasks.<br>Sold in 2021 to a US organisation.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>Since then, I've come back to the world of SaaS, offering my skills and experience, providing "VP Sales-as-a-Service" to US B2B SaaS looking to expand in Europe</p>

                <p>I love the Game of Sales & building teams, processes and automations 😁</p>

                <p>You can read more about my approach to Sales on <a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com" target="_blank">Nic's notes</a>.</p>

                <p>Looking to work with innovative B2B SaaS & AI solutions.</p>

                            <p>I would divide my respect for Nicolas's accomplishments into three key areas:</p>
                            <p>1. MD of EMEA - as our Managing Director for EMEA, Nicolas transformed our execution (particularly on the Sales side), by re-focusing the teams on quantitatively-driven sales management techniques, which resulted in massive growth in our subscription revenue.</p>
                            <p>2. Sales leader peer - Nicolas is a voracious consumer of business texts, as well as a selfless sharer of insights and distilled learnings from that research. I open every email from him with curiosity and interest, and virtually always find pearls that I can implement in my own day-to-day operations.</p>
                            <p>3. Expert in Sales Enablement / Automation field - Nicolas has become extremely interested in sales automation over the past 18-24 months, and has made himself an expert in the area through a multitude of demonstrations, consultations, and texts.</p>
                            <p>I will definitely look to him for advice on how best to outfit my sales teams for success as I proceed in my career.</p>
                            <p>In my experience, Nicolas is a great analyst on almost any business challenge, with extraordinary passion and knowledge specifically in the areas of SaaS and Sales Automation.</p>

                            <p>After very successful years with us Nicolas wanted for personal reasons to move to the UK and left us.</p>
                            <p>During the time he worked for us, he managed to close numerous deals with Tier1 operators in Germany !</p>
                            <p>What makes him one of the best sales guy I met in my life is that on top of his sales skills he has a strong technical understanding coming from the fact that he personally wants to understand.</p>
                            <p>Furthermore Nicolas works autonomously and in a very professional matter.</p>
                            <p>I can only recommend him and hope that our ways will cross again !"</p>

        <h2>About me</h2>


        <p>Hi,</p>


        <p>My name is Nicolas Deville. You can call me Nic.</p>


        <p>I'm French-Austrian, grew up in Paris, living now in Germany after 10 years in London.</p>


        <p>I have been in Sales most of my life, starting when I was a kid, working with my mother for pocket money, helping her as a freelance B2B rep in the 90's!</p>


        <p>I have climbed the Sales career ladder to be the youngest VP Sales, then Managing Director Europe (2x) - both times in VC-backed SaaS startups, encompassing leadership of all local functions (Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, Operations) with a team of 30+.</p>

        Both companies IPO'ed.</p>


        <p>Left the "employee" world in 2017. Bootstrapped and sold two platforms (Convolus.com and <a href="https://officebots.io/" target="_blank">OfficeBots.io</a>) - both to US organisations.</p>


        <p>In 2020, the pandemic meant an opportunity to go back to the world of virtual events, and the opportunity to start offering my skills and experience, providing "Sales-as-a-Service" to US B2B SaaS looking to expand in Europe - doing what I do best, while providing me with a better life balance.</p>


        <p>I love the Game of Sales 😁</p>

        <p>You can read more about my approach to Sales on <a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com" target="_blank">Nic's notes</a>.</p>

        <p>Looking to work with innovative B2B SaaS solutions.</p>

                <p>He is a leader who is truly passionate and committed, not only to the mission, but to his people. He leads in a way that is inspiring, that builds a legion of trusting followers and that makes you realize that each minute you spend listening to him speak is going to benefit your growth tremendously.  Nothing is wasted in his conversations - everything is of value and is meaningful.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Anyone can be a manager and get to end goals with basic skills, but it takes a complex balance of intelligence, mentorship and follow through to be a true leader and to accomplish what Nic has done at ON24.  He is always thinking 18-24 months ahead - how to invest in himself so that he can be better for his people and how he can grow to drive superior results for his organization.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>Nic has redesigned the way I think about growth as an individual and as a leader.  He has simultaneously given me a foundational and strategic understanding of SaaS technologies.  He has opened me up to new ways of thought and completely restructured how I view critical components of corporate operations.  He has been a true mentor - a leader like no other.  I simply can not wait to see what he accomplishes next.</p>

            <div class="reco_body">
                <p></p>

                <p></p>
                <p>I would divide my respect for Nic's accomplishments into three key areas:</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>1. MD of EMEA - as our Managing Director for EMEA, Nic transformed our execution (particularly on the Sales side), by re-focusing the teams on quantitatively-driven sales management techniques, which resulted in massive growth in our subscription revenue.</p>
                <p>2. Sales leader peer - Nicolas is a voracious consumer of business texts, as well as a selfless sharer of insights and distilled learnings from that research.  I open every email from him with curiosity and interest, and virtually always find pearls that I can implement in my own day-to-day operations.</p>
                <p>3. Expert in Sales Enablement / Automation field - Nicolas has become extremely interested in sales automation over the past 18-24 months, and has made himself an expert in the area through a multitude of demonstrations, consultations, and texts. I will definitely look to him for advice on how best to outfit my sales teams for success as I proceed in my career.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>In my experience, Nic is a great analyst on almost any business challenge, with extraordinary passion and knowledge specifically in the areas of SaaS and Sales Automation.  </p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I plan to continue my association with him throughout my career, as he has proven to be an invaluable resource and a proven producer.</p>

                <p>Not only is he hard-working but he is incredibly intelligent, imaginative, and human.  </p>
                <p></p>

                <p>Regardless of how many knock-backs he encounters Nic will persist and try another route. However, what sets Nic apart from others is his ability to not be blinded by that focus.

                <p>Nic is extremely smart and business-savvy. To say he is well-informed in the B2B tech and SaaS area is an understatement. He is able to spot early and small differentiators that set successful companies and individuals apart and apply them to his own area of business.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>I have worked alongside Nic as a colleague, as well as under him as a leader, for over 5 years.

            <div class="nic_blurb">

                <p>Hi,</p>


                <p>My name is Nicolas Deville. You can call me Nic.</p>


                <p>I'm French-Austrian, grew up in Paris, living now in Germany after 10 years in London.</p>


                <p>Been in Sales for most of my life, starting when I was a kid, working with my mother for pocket money, helping her as a freelance B2B rep in the 90's!</p>


                <p>Climbed the Sales career ladder to be the youngest VP Sales, then Managing Director Europe (2x) - both times in VC-backed SaaS startups, encompassing leadership of all local functions (Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, Operations) with a team of 30+.</p>

                Both companies IPO'ed.</p>

                <p>Left the "employee" world in 2017. Bootstrapped and sold two platforms (Convolus.com and <a href="https://officebots.io/" target="_blank">OfficeBots.io</a>) - both to US organisations.</p>


                <p>In 2020, the pandemic meant an opportunity to go back to the world of SaaS (virtual events), offering my skills and experience, providing "Sales-as-a-Service" to US B2B SaaS looking to expand in Europe - doing what I do best, while providing me with a better life balance in this new remote world.</p>


                <p>I love the Game of Sales & building teams, processes and automations 😁</p>

                <p>You can read more about my approach to Sales on <a href="https://notes.nicolasdeville.com" target="_blank">Nic's notes</a>.</p>

                <p>Looking to work with innovative B2B SaaS solutions.</p>
